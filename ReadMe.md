This is a custom countdown timer that allows the user to keep track of the time left to reach a certain day.
The user can enter the title of the countdown as well as the date of the day.  One can type the date manually or use the hand date picker provided. The count down will immediately start on submit. The count down information is stored in local storage. Storing countdown in local storage enables the user to close the page or come back to it another day while the count is still running and unaffected. Once the countdown is over, the user will be alerted. There is also an option to reset the count down
